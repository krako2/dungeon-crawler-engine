# dungeon-crawler-engine

A simple engine for making CLI dungeon crawler games.

## How to run

This is a standard CMake project.

On Windows, download, install and open Visual Studio and install the
appropriate tools (blank project -> Tools -> Get Tools and Features -> Desktop
development with C++), then open the folder and click the green arrow to run.

On Linux, install CMake through your package manager and create a 'build'
folder inside of the repo's directory. Using a terminal inside of the 'build'
folder, run 'cmake ..' followed by 'cmake --build .', then simply
'./dungeon-crawler' to run.

## How to configure

The configuration takes place in a file generated in the same directory by the
executable. It looks like this by default:

```
[ROOMS]

ROOM NUMBER: 100
MESSAGE: You enter a dark room. A light glimmers up north.
CONNECTIONS:
	NORTH: 101
	EAST: None
	SOUTH: None
	WEST: None
CHALLENGE: Physical, Puzzle

ROOM NUMBER: 1
MESSAGE: You enter the winning room. Congrats!
CONNECTIONS:
	NORTH: None
	EAST: None
	SOUTH: None
	WEST: None
CHALLENGE: None

[INTRODUCTORY TEXT]

You arise from a deep rest. There's a door up north.
```

There is some flexibility in the format, though you must use the exact
capitalisation as the above template. The room connection lines (``NORTH:
None``, ``SOUTH: 100``) must be indented with tabs, but the 'CONNECTIONS:'
line may be omitted.

Room number 1 is reserved for the final room of your game. Once this room is
entered, its message is displayed followed by prompt asking you to exit the
program.

As good practise, you should identify all other rooms by room number 10 or
greater.

Currently, there are two types of challenges: physical and puzzle. The
physical challenge spawns a delinquent in the room whom you must attack to
proceed. The puzzle challenge spawns a note with a maths problem you must
solve to proceed.

Add new rooms by adding more of these blocks after the last one, above the
``[INTRODUCTORY TEXT]`` line:

```
ROOM NUMBER: 102
MESSAGE: You enter another room. This is an example.
CONNECTIONS:
	NORTH: None
	EAST: 103
	SOUTH: 119
	WEST: 110
CHALLENGE: Physical, Puzzle, Puzzle, Physical
```

## How to play

Launch the application in a terminal and follow the instructions.
